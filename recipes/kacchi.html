    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The term “kachchi” means raw referring to the biryani ingredients being combined raw in layers instead of first cooking the meat or rice separately. Traditionally, kachchi biryani is cooked in clay oven and the cooking pot is usually sealed with flour dough to allow the biryani to cook in its own steam.  The sealed pot is not opened until the biryani is ready to be served.  Several years ago when I was just starting as a novice cook, I was told many a times that kachchi biryani cannot be made in conventional oven or it wouldn’t taste as good.  However, over the years, through trial and error, I have pretty much perfected the preparation.  First time, I kept the biryani in the oven for 3.5 hours worrying about undercooked meat.  Now I turn off the oven after 1.5 hours.  Also, in my never ending quest to find an easier way, my spin to the recipe is to skip the sealing process with dough and instead just use a lid that perfectly fits the cooking pot; saves time and no sticky fingers and a lot less messy kitchen.  The result is still a flavorful, divine kachchi biryani.</p>
